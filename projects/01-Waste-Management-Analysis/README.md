## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes **Indonesia’s Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) performance in 2024** using the official dataset from the **National Waste Management Information System (SIPSN)**.  
The analysis aims to evaluate **waste generation patterns**, **progress toward national reduction & handling targets**, and identify **strategic priorities** for future interventions.  

This project is part of my **Data Analyst portfolio**, showcasing skills in data cleaning, descriptive analysis, visualization, and policy-oriented insights.  



# Analysis of Indonesia’s Municipal Solid Waste Management 2024  
**Challenges, Achievements, and Strategic Priorities**

---

## 🌍 Impact Statement  
Indonesia generates over **34 million tons of municipal waste annually**, with more than **40% concentrated in Java Island**.  
Yet, only **22.5% of municipalities** meet handling targets, and less than **2% achieve reduction targets**.  
This project analyzes these gaps and explores strategies to improve performance while identifying opportunities for circular economy solutions.

## 📌 Project Motivation  
This project was conducted as part of my **Data Analyst portfolio**, showcasing my ability to:  
- Clean and standardize raw government data.  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
- Visualize insights to support **policy evaluation** and **business impact assessment**.  
- Translate data findings into **actionable recommendations**.

## 📊 Dataset & Coverage  
- **Source**: [SIPSN – Sistem Informasi Pengelolaan Sampah Nasional 2024](https://sipsn.kemenlh.go.id/sipsn/)  
- **Coverage**: 320 out of 514 municipalities (~62%)  
- **Disclaimer**:  
  - Data is **self-reported** by municipalities.  
  - The **2024 projection** is assumed equal to actual 2024 waste generation, used only for portfolio simulation purposes.

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Demonstrated  
- **Programming & Data Handling**: Python (Pandas, NumPy)  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Grouping, aggregation, descriptive statistics  
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Presentation & Storytelling**: PowerPoint, infographic charts  
- **Domain Knowledge**: Waste management policy (Presidential Regulation No. 97/2017)

## 🔑 Key Findings  

### 1. Waste Generation  
- **Total waste**: ~34.63 million tons/year  
- **Average per municipality**: ~108,511 tons/year  
- **Concentration**: West Java (>6M tons), East Java (4.6M), Central Java (3.5M)  

### 2. Lowest Waste Generation  
- **South Papua**: ~26K tons/year (lowest)  
- Other low generators: West Papua, Papua Pegunungan, North Kalimantan  

### 3. City-Level Insights  
- **Highest**: Bogor Regency (~1.02M tons/year)  
- **Lowest**: Tana Tidung (~4.1K tons/year)  

### 4. Per-Capita Waste  
- **Jakarta**: 0.813 kg/person/day (highest)  
- **5-province average**: 0.43 kg/person/day  
- Still **lower than developed countries** (EU ~1.3–1.4 kg/person/day)  

### 5. Performance on Targets  
- **Handling (≥70%)**: Only 22.5% municipalities achieved  
- **Reduction (≥30%)**: Only 1.88% municipalities achieved  
- **Zero performance**: Several regions reported 0% reduction & handling

## 📈 Business & Policy Impact  
1. **Prioritize interventions** in Java & Jakarta → highest leverage.  
2. **Regulatory risk** → failure to achieve *Presidential Regulation No. 97/2017* undermines credibility.  
3. **Technical assistance** → zero-performance areas must be supported.  
4. **Circular economy opportunities** → Jakarta and big cities show potential for recycling, waste-to-energy, and 3R business.  
5. **Urbanization anticipation** → city-based strategies needed to prevent per-capita growth exceeding system capacity.

## 🔮 Next Steps

* Build an **interactive dashboard** (Tableau / Power BI) for real-time exploration.
* Apply **predictive modeling** to forecast future waste generation under different scenarios.
* Expand coverage once more municipalities report complete data.
